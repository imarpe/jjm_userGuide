# User guide of the JJM model :fish: :books:
This repository provides a detailed specification of the Jack Mackerel Joint Model (the JJM model). This model is recognized and used for Jack Mackerel assessment at the SPRFMO Convention. The document includes:

- Algebraic specifications of the assessment model, including the mathematical equations that model the population dynamics of Jack Mackerel.
- Functions defined in the model code to obtain important quantities such as:
  - The Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY)
  - Biological Reference Points (BRPs)
  - Catch projections

For this purpose, we have analyzed the model code located at [this repository](https://github.com/SPRFMO/jjm/blob/main/src/jjm.tpl). The document also covers:

- Input data (dat and ctl files) and key parameters for the assessment, including parameters to be estimated.
- Steps to follow for the installation of the resources and running the model.

Finally, a case study is used to illustrate the use of the JJM model

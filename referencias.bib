abstract="In a well-run fishery, all of the key players (fishermen, biologists, and managers) should be able to state in unambiguous terms what harvest strategy is used for the fishery. A harvest strategy is a plan stating how the catch taken from the stock will be adjusted from year-to-year depending upon the size of the stock, the economic or social conditions of the fishery, conditions of other stocks, and perhaps the state of uncertainty regarding biological knowledge of the stock. Many stocks in the Canadian Atlantic fishery are exploited with a constant harvest rate. Such constant-exploitation-rate strategies are becoming quite popular and have been adopted in the eastern Pacific for Pacific halibut and for herring in British Columbia. Many Pacific salmon stocks are managed on the basis of an escapement goal, by which managers attempt to adjust the catch every year so that the same number of fish reach the spawning grounds. This type of harvest strategy is also known as a constant-stock-size strategy. Another type of harvest strategy involves taking a constant catch, or fixed quota, from the stock every year. In the Tasmanian abalone fishery, for many years every licensed fisherman was permitted to harvest 28 tons of abalone each year",
